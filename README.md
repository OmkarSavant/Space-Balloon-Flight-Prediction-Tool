# Space-Balloon-Flight-Prediction-Tool
This is a tool I wrote in MATLAB that takes inputs about balloon mass, payload mass, and volume to determine the vertical trajectory of the balloon as a function of time. This functionality is used by our High Altitude Balloon team when determining aerial photography and altitude changing maneuvers.
